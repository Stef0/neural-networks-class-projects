# neural-networks-class-projects

The class projects for the neural networks 2017/2018 class at Radboud University. 
The projects are simple implementations of some famous architectures, done in the deep learning framework Chainer for Python.

as a short description (more detail is in the single scripts):

MLP.py is an implementation of a classical multy-layer perceptron, trained to classify digits from the mnist dataset.
convolutional.py is a convoutional network, trained on the same mnist dataset and compared to the previous MLP script.
chainer LSTM.py is an implementation of an LSTM network for some toy sequence data defined in the beginning of the script.
Q learning.py is an implementation of a Q learning algorithm extended with a MLP as a function approximator. 
GAN.py is an implementation of a GAN net that learns to draw numbers while unsupervised.
